&emsp;&emsp;Sentiment analysis by neural networks (LLMs are prohibited)

&emsp;&emsp;Method: Using CNN + RNN + Attention Layer

&emsp;&emsp;Note: You need to download "glove.6B.300d.txt" and place it to the same folder to run the code

## &emsp;HW3 - Machine Reading Comprehension

&emsp;&emsp;https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/111-1-nlp-hw3

&emsp;&emsp;Chinese multiple-choice questions answering (c3 dataset)

&emsp;&emsp;https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2022-inlp-final

&emsp;&emsp;Fact checking with almost useless raw evidences

&emsp;&emsp;Method: TF-IDF + BERT fine-tuning

&emsp;&emsp;"train_evidence_v3.json", "valid_evidence_v3.json", "test_evidence_v3.json" are produced by Final_TFIDF_v3.py
